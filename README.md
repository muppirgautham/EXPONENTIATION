# Find the exponentiation of a number

## AIM:
To write a program to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Get the input from the user.
2. Use exponentiation operator to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Program:
```
/*
Program to find the exponentiation of a number.
Developed by: GAUTHAM M G
RegisterNumber: 21000182
*/
def exponent(x):
    exp=x**2
    print("Exponentiation of a given number:",exp)
x=int(input())
exponent(x)
```

## Output:

## Result:
Thus the program to find the exponentiation of a given number is written and verified using python programming.
